# `rems2aquachem`

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of `rems2aquachem` is to provide a quick and painless way of converting 
EMS data into a format compatible with AquaChem.

Data is first downloaded with BC Govs [`rems`](http://github.com/bcgov/rems) 
package, then formatted for use by AquaChem.

## Installation steps

1. [**Update RStudio**](https://rstudio.com/) (if it's been a while)

2. [**Update R**](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (if it's been a while)

3. **Open RStudio**

4. **Install `remotes`** In the console type the following and hit enter

     ```{r, eval = FALSE}
     install.packages("remotes")
     ```
     
5. **Update `rems`** In the console type the following and hit enter

     ```{r, eval = FALSE}
     remotes::install_github("bcgov/rems")
     ```
     
    > **Note:** If you run into errors during the `rems` data updates, this might 
    > be due to old rems caches. 
    > 
    > **Try the following:** 
    >  1. Uninstall `rems` - RStudio, go to the lower right hand window, click 
    >     on the "Packages" tab, in the search bar, search for "rems", then 
    >     click on the "X" in a circle to the right of it's name.
    > 
    > 2. Remove the `rems` cache - Delete the cache folders by going to 
    >    C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Local (windows) or 
    >    ~/Library/Application Support (mac) and delete the "rems" folder
    > 
    > 3. Re-install `rems` remotes::install_github("bcgov/rems") and 
    >    then try again

     
6. **Install `rems2aquachem`** In the console type the following and hit enter 
(be sure to install all updates if prompted!)
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    remotes::install_github("bcgov/rems2aquachem")
    ```

If you run into errors right at the start, consider updating your packages.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::update_packages()
```

  
## Using `rems2aquachem`

### Shiny GUI

    ```

2. Next, launch the shiny GUI. 

    Type the following in the console and hit enter

    ```{r eval = FALSE}

### R command line

For advanced users, `rems2aquachem` can be used directly from R.

Downloads, converts and saves to csv
 
```{r example}
library(rems2aquachem)
r <- rems_to_aquachem(ems_ids = c("1401030", "1401377", "E292373"))
r
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
file.remove(paste0("aquachem_", Sys.Date(), ".csv"))
```

Create plots

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.width = 8, fig.asp = 1}
piper_plot(r, ems_id = "1401030")
```

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.width = 6, fig.asp = 0.75}
stiff_plot(r, ems_id = "1401030")
```
