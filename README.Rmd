# `bcgwcat` - Groundwater Chemistry Analysis Tool

The goal of `bcgwcat` is to provide easy access to EMS data as well as
tools specific to those working with groundwater through R functions but
also through a **Shiny user-interface**. This tool can help with:

- Converting data to a format for importing into AquaChem
- Providing new charge balance calculations
- Calculating water types (code only)
- Providing water quality summaries
- Piperplots and Stiff plots


Data is first downloaded with BC Govs [`rems`](http://github.com/bcgov/rems) 
package, then formatted for use by AquaChem and the other tools provided

## Quick Start

- Install [**R**](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [**RStudio**](https://rstudio.com/)
- Install remotes - `install.packages("remotes")`
- Install bcgwcat - `remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcgwcat")`
- Launch the Shiny App - `gw_app()`


## Installing

1. [**Update RStudio**](https://rstudio.com/) (if it's been a while)
2. [**Update R**](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (if it's been a while)
3. **Open RStudio**
4. **Install remotes** In the console type the following and hit enter

     ```{r, eval = FALSE}
     install.packages("remotes")
     ```
5. **Update `rems`** In the console type the following and hit enter

     ```{r, eval = FALSE}
     remotes::install_github("bcgov/rems")
     ```
     
    > **Note:** If you run into errors during the `rems` data updates, this might 
    > be due to old rems caches. 
    > 
    > **Try the following:** 
    >  1. Uninstall `rems` - RStudio, go to the lower right hand window, click 
    >     on the "Packages" tab, in the search bar, search for "rems", then 
    >     click on the "X" in a circle to the right of it's name.
    > 
    > 2. Remove the `rems` cache - Delete the cache folders by going to 
    >    `C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Local` (windows) or 
    >    `~/Library/Application Support (mac)` and delete the "rems" folder
    > 
    > 3. Re-install rems `remotes::install_github("bcgov/rems")` and 
    >    then try again

     
6. **Install `bcgwcat`** In the console type the following and hit enter 
(be sure to install all updates if prompted!)
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcgwcat")
    ```

If you run into errors right at the start, consider updating your packages.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::update_packages()
```

  
## Using `bcgwcat`

### Shiny GUI

1. In RStudio, first load the `bcgwcat` package (this must be done every time)

    ```{r}
    library(bcgwcat)
    ```

2. Next, launch the shiny GUI. 

    Type the following in the console and hit enter

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    bcgwcat_app()
    ```
    
**See the [tutorial](https://bcgov.github.io/bcgwcat/articles/bcgwcat.html) for a more in-depth look at the GUI**

### R command line

For advanced users, `bcgwcat` can be used directly from R.

Downloads, converts and saves to csv
 
```{r example}
library(bcgwcat)
r <- rems_to_aquachem(ems_ids = c("1401030", "1401377", "E292373"))
r
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
file.remove(paste0("aquachem_", Sys.Date(), ".csv"))
```

Create plots

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.width = 8, fig.asp = 1}
piper_plot(r, ems_id = "1401030")
```

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.width = 6, fig.asp = 0.75}
stiff_plot(r, ems_id = "1401030")
```
