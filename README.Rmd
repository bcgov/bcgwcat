# bcgwcat - Groundwater Chemistry Analysis Tool

> *Previously known as rems2aquachem, as the scope of this tool has expanded,
> we have renamed it to better reflect what it does*

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/",
  out.width = "100%"
)
```

The goal of bcgwcat is to provide easy access to EMS data as well as
tools specific to those working with groundwater through R functions but
also through a **Shiny user-interface**. This tool can help with:

- Downloading EMS data via the [rems](http://github.com/bcgov/rems) package
- Calculating charge balances
- Calculating water types
- Converting data to a format for importing into AquaChem
- Providing water quality summaries
- Piperplots and Stiff plots

## Quick Start

- Install [**R**](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [**RStudio**](https://rstudio.com/)
- Install pak - `install.packages("pak")`
- Install bcgwcat - `pak::pkg_install("bcgov/bcgwcat")` [Update All if asked]
- Launch the Shiny App - `gw_app()`


## In Detail

1. [**Update RStudio**](https://rstudio.com/) (if it's been a while)
2. [**Update R**](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (if it's been a while)
3. **Open RStudio**
4. **Install pak** In the console type the following and hit enter

     ```{r, eval = FALSE}
     install.packages("pak")
     ```
5. **Install bcgwcat** In the console type the following and hit enter 
(be sure to install all updates if prompted!)
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    pak::pkg_install("bcgov/bcgwcat")
    ```
    
#### Troubleshooting

1. **Update rems** In the console type the following and hit enter

     ```{r, eval = FALSE}
     pak::pkg_install("bcgov/rems")
     ```
     
    > **Note:** If you run into errors during the rems data updates, this might 
    > be due to old rems caches. 
    > 
    > **Try the following:** 
    >  1. Uninstall rems - RStudio, go to the lower right hand window, click 
    >     on the "Packages" tab, in the search bar, search for "rems", then 
    >     click on the "X" in a circle to the right of it's name.
    > 
    > 2. Remove the rems cache - Delete the cache folders by going to 
    >    `C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Local` (windows) or 
    >    `~/Library/Application Support (mac)` and delete the "rems" folder
    > 
    > 3. Re-install rems `pak::pkg_install("bcgov/rems")` and 
    >    then try again
  
2. **Update all packages** If you run into errors right at the start, consider updating your packages.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    pak::pkg_install("bcgov/bcgwcat", upgrade = TRUE)
    ```

## Using bcgwcat

#### Shiny User-Interface

Type this line into the R console at the prompt (in the screen with `>`) and
hit 'Enter'.
   ```{r, eval = FALSE}
   bcgwcat::gw_app() # Launch the app
   ```
    
**See the [tutorial](https://bcgov.github.io/bcgwcat/articles/bcgwcat.html) for a more in-depth look at how to use the User Interface**

#### R command line

bcgwcat can also be used directly from R.

To extract EMS data, and convert for use in AquaChem... (by default saved as CSV)
 
```{r example}
library(bcgwcat)
r <- rems_to_aquachem(ems_ids = c("1401030", "1401377", "E292373"))
r
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
file.remove(paste0("aquachem_", Sys.Date(), ".csv"))
```

To create plots...

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.width = 8, fig.asp = 1}
piper_plot(r, ems_id = "1401030")
```

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.width = 6, fig.asp = 0.75}
stiff_plot(r, ems_id = "1401030")
```
